# Site UI Template
Hello, this is a web design template I created to make frontend development much easier. To use it you can simply download it and jump right into the html if you want but before you do there are some parts of this format you should understand.

## ESLint <image src="https://www.blog.plint-sites.nl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/eslint-logo-300x300.png" width=20px style="display: inline">
[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is the formatter used to style our code, if you want to override it, go to the [eslintConfig section of package.json](package.json) and modify the rules as you see fit.

## Webpack <image src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-big.png" width=20px style="display: inline">
Webpack is used to compile all assets into one html site at the same time, [Webpack Dev Server]() is also included for allowing you to see live code changes immediately without having to reload your html page. **Use the available NPM scripts to run the program.**

## Pug <image src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a43de8ca816e78b1c2666f7696f449b2eeddbeca/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e7261776769742e636f6d2f7075676a732f7075672d6c6f676f2f656563343336636565386664396431373236643738333963626539396431663639343639326330632f5356472f7075672d66696e616c2d6c6f676f2d5f2d636f6c6f75722d3132382e737667" width=20px style="display: inline">
Pug is this templates HTML format of choice, [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) is pretty to learn and it just makes writing complex html much easier to create and change when needed.

## SCSS/SASS <image src="https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/logos/logo-b6e1ef6e.svg" width=20px style="display: inline">
[SASS or syntactically awesome style sheets](https://sass-lang.com/guide) is just a modification of css that allows you to use variables, run for loops to create iterations of a style and similar stuff, css is still valid in it however it adds on stuff like nested styles that make it much more appealing than just standard css.

## Typescript <image src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/typescript.svg" width=20px style="display: inline">
[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a subset of javascript developed by Microsoft, all that's important about it is that it allows you to enforce the types of your variables and you can also make documentation with it for your javascript/typescript code. [NetNinja has a really good tutorial on Typescript](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) that you should watch if you are unfamiliar with it.
